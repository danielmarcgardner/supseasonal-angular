# Supseasonal - Angular

Supseasonal - Angular is a front end application built for the [Supseasonal API](http://supseasonal.herokuapp.com/) built by two other G42 students for their Q2 project. It allows users to see seasonal ingredients that are available by month or when the ingredients are available seasonally. Users can also search for recipes that use seasonal ingredients.

Supseasonal-Angular is my first Angular project built as a refactor of [Supseasonal-React](https://github.com/danielmarcgardner/supseasonal-react). This was a self taught dive into Angular built over the course of four days.
